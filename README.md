# Hackmanthan-Sentimental-Analysis

The Dataset was of Twitter - Which contained 1600000 rows of data, but since my Laptop has not that much compatibility I used 100000 rows of the data

The Model has the ability to Judge the Sentiments which are associated with the Text.<br />
These Sentiments are Characterized as: NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of things are still left which could have been improved, keeping in the mind the capability of my Laptop<br/>
<br/>
#For Example:-
The Accuracy right now is roughly around 76%, with the Dataset of (100000,6)<br/>
But the original Data set is of 16 lakh rows.<br/>
I have also used less Epochs, which could have even increased the Efficiency/Accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
This Model is efficient in Analysing the English Sentences, but I have thought the solution for the Hindi Text as well<br/>
Just use INLTK library and everything for text-conversion to tokenization can be done of Hindi Sentences.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only this a proper Web application will be enabled which will directly fetch the data from any Social Media platform, with just the link for that post.
<br/>
The technique used there will be Web Scrapping, basically Selenium can make the work easier.
<br/>
<br/>
The project can be deployed on Heroku Furthermore, so that it cab be accessible to everyone.<br/>
Thank You
